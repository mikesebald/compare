## Challenge {data-transition="zoom"}

- A customer want's to upgrade to a next version of the Uniser Customer Data 
Hub. Such an upgrade usually includes new versions of Post, reference tables, 
convertName and CDH itself.

> - Since there are so many changes involved with such an upgrade, we want to 
be sure that the actual results created by such are an installation are at least 
of the same quality than in the previous or current software stack. We may also 
want to provide such evidence to the customer who wants to perform the upgrade.

## Approach {data-transition="slide-in fade-out"}

- Since the validation results are created by Uniserv components, the idea was 
to explicitly NOT use any existing Uniserv software. However using software 
from any of our competitors is of course a no-go as well. So we decided to 
perform  the comparison by solely using **publicly available open-source 
software**.

> - Considering the highly customizable data model of CDH which allows for 
customer specific data models, the appraoch must be flexible to analyse such 
differences and to adapt the model accordingly. Therefore we followed an 
**exploratory data analysis** approach.

> - Finally we wanted to have something which allows us to *publish* the 
results in different ways (a presentation or reports in PDF or Word or 
whatever) according to the specific needs of the analysis - with **minimal 
effort**.

## How did we do it?

We have decided to use **R** to perform the comparison for the following 
reasons:

- R is open source (GPL-2|GPL-3)
- R is an object-oriented interactive language which is perfectly suited for 
analyzing and processing data step by step
- R provides out-of-the-box functionality to create data analysis reports (this 
presentation is created using so called R markdown)

<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/technology/business-computing/07program.html>

## So what did we do?

- The first question was: where do we get the data from? Since the analysis was
done in the context of a CDH project, we decided to use the **CSV export feature
provided by CDH**.

- Next we loaded these exports into R and started analyzing. During the 
analysis we found out that we forgot to ask the most important question: what 
are we looking for or what are our KPIs we want to create? Luckily R is 
perfectly suited to go into various directions and to **explore** the data as 
you go.

- At the end we *wrote* the report (this presentation) about our findings.

## Hurdles

There are two issues (Ticket 5426) in the CSV export of CDH 15.4:

1. All status columns are empty
2. The columns member.source, member.key, and labels are missing in the golden 
record export

Unfortunately this does not allow us to compare the matching results, because we
just have golden record IDs but no member IDs to compare

Secondly we can only compare valid records. However, it would have been nice to
compare *all* valid addresses and not just the addresses of valid records.


## Comparing CDH 15.4 and 16.1

Number of member records in both CDH versions:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot.rows <- plot_ly(total.rows, x = system, y = rows, 
                     name = "Valid Rows", type = "bar")
layout(plot.rows, barmode = "stack")
```

## Valid in A, but not in B

We also had records which are valid in just one system, but not in the other 
system:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot.differents <- plot_ly(differents, x = system, y = counts, 
                           name = "Records which are valid in just one system", 
                           type = "bar")
layout(plot.differents, barmode = "stack")
```

## So why did we have such records?

Example:

## Differences in address attributes

Which of the postal address attributes are different and how many are different?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot.differents <- plot_ly(df_columns, x = attributes, y = occurences, 
                           name = "Number of Differences per Attributes", 
                           type = "bar")
layout(plot.differents, barmode = "stack")
```

## End

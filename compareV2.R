# so now we know if there is a difference in the number of valid records. It is
# just the total number. There might be different records validated in system A 
# and system B so there might be different sets of data valid.
# So which records are valid in BOTH systems and how many of them are there?
# However: a record can be valid in both system A and B but with a different 
# validation result.
# Before we start joining, we have to keep in mind that each party can have 
# multiple addresses, phone numbers and other entities. So the records get 
# "exploded" i.e. we have a lot of redundant data per party.
#
# TODO: If we have become very clever with R and JSON we may switch from the 
#       CSV/line based apporoach to an unstructured/document style.
#
# Also we want to measure the difference in address validation and name 
# validation, so it might be the right time now to split the data sets. In order
# todo so, we review the column.names data frame created above and select the 
# relevant columns for subsetting
